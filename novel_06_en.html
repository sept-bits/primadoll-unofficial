<p>"I see, so a one-year live-in apprenticeship."</p>
<br>
<p>We were on the second floor of the Black Cat Pavilion inside of a reception room separated from the rest of the cafe by a frosted glass partition.</p>
<p>I was sitting with my back straight facing a woman.</p>
<p>She was sitting with her long, slender legs crossed as she looked over a document on the desk in front of her. The document was a thin sheet of paper on which I had carefully written out my resume.</p>
<p>Her hair was mostly tied back in a bun, but what had been left out had a gentle wave to it. She was holding a fountain pen in her right hand. From time to time she gave me a cool appraising glance. When she looked at me her eyes took on a somewhat frightening intensity.</p>
<br>
<p>"Kakunoya-machi would mean the president of Kamikura Iron & Steel works?"</p>
<p>"You're well informed."</p>
<p>"I've been there in the past. They were the preferred partner of the military.</p>
<br>
<p>The chair creaked as she stood.</p>
<p>I couldn't help but look up at her. She was quite tall for a woman - though I suppose her high heels did play some part in that.</p>
<br>
<p>"When did you retire from the military, Okumiya-san?"</p>
<p>"It'll soon be 3 years since I retired."</p>
<br>
<p>Okumiya Otome. Former military. The owner of the Black Cat Pavilion.</p>
<p>She went to stand by the window. Everything about her had a feel of elegance. All of the soldiers that I had known were on the coarse side, but she was the opposite.</p>
<br>
<p>"You... must have been high ranking."</p>
<br>
<p>I was sure there was a better way to ask about this sort of thing, but whenever I made the attempt, it always came out sounding foolish.</p>
<br>
<p>Otome: "My rank when I retired was Major."</p>
<p>"Hahaa... it seems like a bit of a waste, somehow."</p>
<p>Otome: "Hardly. Soldiers aren't exactly popular nowadays."</p>
<br>
<p>She smiled and her eyes glittered with humor. Her voice was calm and reassuring.</p>
<br>
<p>"And then you opened the Black Cat Pavilion?"</p>
<p>Otome: "I have a few different ventures currently.</p>
<p>I took over the Black Cat Pavilion from a friend."</p>
<br>
<p>She glanced over at the wall.</p>
<p>There was a framed photograph on the wall that showed several dolls and the previous owner.</p>
<br>
<p>Otome: "It's an exhausting business that shows no signs of being lucrative."</p>
<p>"No, I'm sure it will be popular."</p>
<p>Otome: "You think so?"</p>
<p>Yes, absolutely."</p>
<p>Otome: "How is your cooking?"</p>
<p>"I haven't made a living as a cook before, but I've prepared a lot of meals.</p>
<p>I've been praised for my cooking. And I can handle customers.</p>
<p>I've done a bit of everything since I was a child. My first job was selling boxed lunches at the train station...."</p>
<p>Otome: "You're hired."</p>
<br>
<p>Just as I'd expected, Okumiya-san didn't hesitate to make decisions.</p>
<br>
<p>Otome: "I'm sure you'll fit right in. I look forward to working with you."</p>
<br>
<p>She held out her right hand.</p>
<p>It took me a second to realize that she was waiting for me to shake her hand.</p>
<br><br>
<p>"Y-Yes! I'll do my best!"</p>
<p>I took her hand in both of mine and shook it.</p>
<p>Her hands were slim and delicate. It was hard to imagine that she had been a soldier.</p>
<br />

<br />
<p>With hands freshly washed, a new shirt and apron put on, and hair carefully contained underneath a cap I stood in front of the mirror to check my appearance. I looked pretty good. It would have been nice to have a tall, white chef's hat... but that was asking a bit much.</p>
<br>

			</ul>
		</div>
	</div>
</div>


<br>
<p>A voice from behind me interrupted my cheerful thoughts of hats.</p>
<br>
<p>"Huh...?"</p>
<br>
<p>I looked around the room but there was nobody in sight. How odd, I could swear I had heard someone....</p>
